# Project Overview

Inventory Manager CLI is a Python-based command-line application that enables users to efficiently track and manage product stock.

It allows users to:

- Add new products  
- Edit existing product details  
- Delete unwanted entries  
- Search products by name  
- Export inventory to CSV  
- Import inventory from CSV  
- Automatically save data to JSON  

All operations include **error handling**, **input validation**, and **clear user feedback**.

The project aligns with the Code Institute’s *Python Essentials* assessment requirements and demonstrates clean code, modular functions, defensive programming, and robust data handling.

# User Goals

- Easily manage product information  
- Search for products quickly  
- Import/export inventory files  
- Use a simple and intuitive interface  

# Site Owner Goals

- Provide a reliable database-like system using JSON  
- Ensure the user cannot break the application through invalid input  
- Offer helpful messages and confirmations  
- Maintain clean, maintainable, readable code  

---

# Features

### ✔ Add Product
Adds a new item with:
- Name  
- Quantity  
- Price  
With validation:
- Positive values  
- Non-empty names  
- Handles `ValueError` gracefully  

### ✔ Update Product
Allows modifying:
- Quantity  
- Price  
Empty input keeps the original value.

### ✔ Delete Product
Deletes by ID, with confirmation prompt:
```
Are you sure? (y/n)
```

### ✔ Search Products
Case-insensitive partial search.  
Example: “app” matches “Apple” and “Pineapple”.

### ✔ Export to CSV
Exports the inventory into `inventory_export.csv`.

### ✔ Import from CSV  
Reads `inventory_import.csv` and adds products.  
Invalid rows are skipped safely.

### ✔ JSON Data Persistence
Data automatically loads at startup and saves on exit.

### ✔ Defensive Programming
- Handles invalid numeric inputs  
- Catches missing files  
- Prevents negative values  
- Protects against corrupted JSON  

---

# Data Model

Product structure stored in `inventory.json`:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Apple",
    "quantity": 10,
    "price": 1.5
}
```

The inventory is a list of these objects.

# PEP8 Validation

The Python code was validated using:

- **Code Institute Python Linter**  
- **PEP8 Online Validator**

Results:

✔ No major issues  
✔ Proper indentation  
✔ No unused variables  
✔ No overly long lines  
✔ Clean and readable code  

---

# Bugs and Fixes

### Fixed:
- Incorrect function ordering → reorganized  
- Indentation error in `update_product` → fixed  
- Missing CSV import validation → added `try/except`  
- Non-PEP8 formatting → full refactor  

### Remaining Bugs:
No known bugs at the time of submission.
